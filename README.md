# Preprocessing-and-Analysis-of-Used-Cars-Dataset-
In this Big Data project, I have explored a dataset containing details of 3 million real-world used cars. The dataset was obtained byrunning a self-made crawler on Cargurus inventory in September 2020. My task was to preprocess the data using PySpark, perform various analyses, and answer specific questions related to the dataset.
Project Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing: Calculate the percentage of null values for each column and
eliminate columns containing over 20% null values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
● Analyze the distribution of vehicle types in the dataset.
● Determine the most common fuel type among the listed vehicles.
● Calculate the average horsepower of vehicles with the most common fuel type.
● Explore the distribution of city_fuel_economy across different cities.
3. Advanced Analysis:
● Identify the city and body_type combination with the highest average
city_fuel_economy.
● Examine the price trend over the years for the top 5 most popular body_types and
visualize it.
● Investigate the relationship between back_legroom and body_type using
correlation analysis and visualization.
